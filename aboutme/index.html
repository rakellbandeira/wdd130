    <p>Hey guys! Rakell here, hope everyone is feeling as excited as me!</p>
    <p>I'm a brazilian designer who loves this digital world and its wonders. My goal is to specialize in Web and Mobile Development or any similar degree that allows me get jobs designing programs, web and mobile applications.
        Anyone with the same goal as me? Anyway, I have a 4-years-old princess, am single and member of the Church for my lifetime. I enjoy books, series, drawing, singing and playing piano.</p>
    <p></p>What I love the most about BYU is having this A-M-A-Z-I-N-G quality of content, teachers and classmates from all the parts of the world, besides the weekly devotionals and spiritual focus. You don't have it anywhere, I dare you to find. I'm pursuing Applied Technology BS degree and this time the ship is going to sail hahaha no giving up until get it done.  
    <p>I have many favorite verses on the BM, but lately I was reading this one I would like to share:</p>
    <p><italic>"Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means the Lord has provided for us?"</italic> ALMA 60: 21. If we make use of ALL the means the Lord has provided us, He will deliver us.</p>
    <p>Hoping we can help each other and bond along this already wonderful semester.</p>
    <p>Thanks,</p>
    <p>Rakell.</p>
